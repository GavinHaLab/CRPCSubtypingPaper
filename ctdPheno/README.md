# ctdPheno

ctdPheno is a probabilistic approach for classifying tumor phenotypes from circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). 

Publication/reference: awaiting DOI...

## Description
The key features of ctdPheno is that it accounts for the ctDNA fraction (i.e. tumor fraction estimated by [ichorCNA](https://github.com/GavinHaLab/ichorCNA)) to adjust the expected signals for the tumor phenotype and the non-tumor cfDNA component.

ctdPheno uses cfDNA fragment features extracted from nucleosome coverage profiles computed by [Griffin](https://github.com/GavinHaLab/Griffin). 

For castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), these Griffin features were extracted for adenocarcinoma prostate cancer (ARPC) and neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). We used patient-derived xenograft plasma ctDNA because it provides pure human ctDNA signals from which ctdPheno can incorporate the tumor fraction to adjust the expected mixtures for tumor and non-tumor cfDNA components.

## Usage and functions
Functions for using the ctdPheno model: inputs include a feature matrix in pickle format for both the reference data
(to inform the model, e.g. LuCaP features and healthy normal features) and the samples of interest.

df_diff() is first run on the reference data to find features differentially regulated between the two subtypes of interest;
metric_dict() then takes the differential dataframe and produces a dicitonary of prior estimates for use in the model. Finally,
beta_descent() uses the priors from metric_dict to generate predictions based on the sample dataframe, which are output to .tsv.
